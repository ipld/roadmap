# IPLD Roadmap

## IPLD Vision

Create the Internet of data-structures.

### Requirements

1. IPLD must provide primitives for building decentralized data-structures.
2. IPLD must provide data-structures for common applications.
3. IPLD must provide specifications for representing common types of data.
4. IPLD data-structures must easily replicate across peers.

## 2019 Top Level Targets

1. **Q1** Selectors & Interface Updates
   - [ ] Create selector engines for Go and JavaScript
   - [ ] Migrate JavaScript interfaces to async/await and async generators
   - [ ] First version of ipld-prime and schemas for Go
2. **Q2** Codify Primitives
   - [ ] Iterate and integrate ipld-prime and schemas in Go
   - [ ] Iterate and integrate changes to JS interfaces (async/await)
   - [ ] First version of experimental collections in JavaScript
   - [ ] unixfs-v2 implementation in JavaScript
3. **Q3** Build things w/ IPLD
   - [ ] Identify some Proof-of-Concept projects to build w/ IPLD
4. **Q4** Rethink API layers and abstractions
   - [ ] After spending a quarter using IPLD to build "real stuff," return 
         to the interfaces and layers and iterate.

## OKR's

Quarter OKR's (Objective, Key Result) are in the [okr directory](./okrs).
