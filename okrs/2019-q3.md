## Objective: Projects that depend on IPLD are using new interfaces and specifications

| There is a complete IPLD Schema for UnixFSv2 | @mikeal | ![p0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV88khHDJEXi7wo6o972MZWY661R9PhrZW6dvpFP6jnMn/p0.svg) | 0.9 | 1 | |
| There is a spec for additional attributes in UnixFSv1 | @mikeal | ![p0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV88khHDJEXi7wo6o972MZWY661R9PhrZW6dvpFP6jnMn/p0.svg) | 0.7 | 1 | |
| go-ipld-prime is fast and easy to use | @warpfork | ![p0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV88khHDJEXi7wo6o972MZWY661R9PhrZW6dvpFP6jnMn/p0.svg) | | 0.5 | |

For `go-ipld-prime` we expect this KR to be 50% complete in Q3, which means a functioning
codegen API based on IPLD Schema. Another quarter of refinements and performance work is 
expected after that.

## Objective: Realize the vision of decentralized linkable advanced data structures

### Notes

The key result "Rust can compile functions to WASM that can speak the complete data model to JS" was put on hold as a proposal for [WebAssembly Interface Types](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/webassembly-interface-types/) came out, which will be explored in Q4.
